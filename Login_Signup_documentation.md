Documentation: Login / Signup
This documentation provides an overview of the login and signup functionality implemented in the project. It covers how users can sign up for a new account and log in to access the application.

1. Overview
The login and signup features allow users to create a new account and authenticate themselves to access the application. These features are essential for controlling access to protected resources and personalizing the user experience.

2. Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Password Encryption: Bcrypt
3. Functionality
Signup
Users can sign up for a new account by providing their first name, last name, email, password, confirm password, and passport number.
Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
User data is validated on the client-side to ensure all required fields are filled and that the password and confirm password fields match.
Upon successful signup, users receive a JWT token that is used for subsequent authentication.
Login
Registered users can log in to their accounts by providing their email and password.
The provided credentials are validated against the stored data in the database.
If the credentials are valid, the user receives a JWT token for authentication.
The token is stored locally on the client side for subsequent requests.
4. Implementation Details
Frontend
The signup and login forms are implemented using React.js components.
Form validation is performed using React state and event handlers to ensure data integrity before submission.
JWT tokens are stored in the browser's local storage upon successful authentication.
Backend
Backend routes are implemented using Express.js to handle signup and login requests.
User data is stored and managed using MongoDB, with Mongoose serving as the ORM.
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database to ensure security.
JWT tokens are generated upon successful authentication and returned to the client.
5. Usage
Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend.
Configure the environment variables for the backend server, including the MongoDB connection URI and JWT secret.
Start the backend server on port 5000.
Start the frontend development server on port 3000.
Access the application in your web browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000 and navigate to the signup/login pages to create an account or log in.
6. Future Enhancements
Implement additional security measures such as rate limiting and CSRF protection.
Add email verification for new account registration.
Enhance the user interface and experience with more interactive features.
